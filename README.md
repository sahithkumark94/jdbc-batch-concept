# POSTGRES BATCH INSERT
    Here, I'm using Postgres DB and do batch insertion and update.
    The main purpose is like we can do the bulk data update/Creation will be very much faster
    Incase of spring boot JAP and Hibernet we can't acheive the bulk insertion very faster.
    Instude of JDBC we can use.

## Dependency
    - Java 8
    - Maven latest version
    - Postgres

## Screenshotes

    The data insertion screenshots are given in the repository itself.
